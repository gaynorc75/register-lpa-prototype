# GOV.UK Prototype Kit starter prototype (unofficial)

A prototype guide built using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk), for online code editors such as:

 - [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
 - [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)

This is especially useful if you cannot install the kit on your computer.
